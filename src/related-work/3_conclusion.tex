\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:related:conclusion}

Given the constraints formulated in
\crossref{sec:intro}{sec:intro:problems}, we are not able to
leverage white-box or documentation-based works. For the record,
we cannot safely reuse existing documentation. Due to the
heterogeneous set of software we target, we cannot rely on
white-box approaches either.

In the sequel, we present two approaches combining passive model
inference, machine learning, and expert systems to infer models
from traces for web applications (Chapter
\ref{sec:modelinf:webapps}) and industrial systems (Chapter
\ref{sec:modelinf:prodsystems}).  Our work is similar to those
using event sequence abstraction (page
\pageref{sec:passive-fsa}), except that state merging is replaced
with a context-specific state reduction based on an event
sequence abstraction. This state reduction can be seen as the
kTail algorithm introduced previously where $k$ is as high as
possible. Furthermore, our work focus on both speed and
scalability to be able to construct models of Michelin's
production systems in an efficient manner. Among all potential
use cases, we need such models to perform passive testing on
these production systems.
