\chapter{State of the art}
\label{sec:related}

In this chapter, we survey the literature in software testing
first, and then in model inference applied to software systems.
We start by introducing what software testing means, mentioning
some important notions as well as the different types of testing.
We then present what Model-based Testing (MbT) is, along with a
few definitions and common terms employed in MbT. The software
testing part ends with a review on some passive testing
techniques, and why they are interesting in our case. The second
part of this chapter presents what model inference is, from
active inference, \emph{i.e.} methods interacting with a software
system to extract knowledge about it, to passive inference,
\emph{i.e.} techniques that infer models from a fixed set of
knowledge, such as a set of execution traces, source code,
or even documentation.\\
