\chapter{Testing applied to production systems}
\label{sec:testing}

In this chapter, we tackle the problem of testing production
systems (as defined in the previous chapter), without disturbing
them, and without having any specification \emph{a priori}. Those
two constraints sounds familiar as they have already been taken
into consideration in the previous chapter. We present a passive
testing technique built on-top of \emph{Autofunk v3}. First, we
infer reference models of a system under analysis $\mathit{Sua}$.
Then, we check whether a system under test $\mathit{Sut}$
conforms to these inferred models by means of two implementation
relations. We use the trace preorder relation to strictly check
conformance between the two systems. Because the inferred models
are partial, they likely lack information, which implies that a
strict relation may be too strong. That is why we propose our own
(weaker) implementation relation to comply with Michelin's needs.
Such a relation is less strict than the trace preorder relation
in order to accept non-standard behaviors down to a certain point.
These two relations are leveraged in two algorithms for
performing both offline and online passive conformance testing.
We end this chapter with an evaluation on our offline approach.\\
